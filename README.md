# Kooomo Front-end Test

The goal of this exercise is to access the knowledge of the most common Front-end skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API consumption.
We'll evaluate your code in all those aspects as well as the code style, the attention to detail and the way you approach the test, and the problems you face while developing it.
Feel free to leave comments explaining your decisions and to use any tool or framework of your choice.
