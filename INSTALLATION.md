CORS problem

Simple fix is to install a browser extension that disables CORS. For example, [this one](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc).

OR

Just upload the final build to a server and it should work fine.

You can find the project live demo [here](https://kooomo-motogp-store.vercel.app/).
